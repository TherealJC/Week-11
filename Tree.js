//A JavaScript tree is a special data structure that implements the hierarchical tree structure with a root node, child and parent
// nodes and leaf nodes represented as a set of linked nodes.
//A tree data structure is a collection of nodes, starting with a root node, with data values in each of the nodes
//along with the reference to the child nodes. The root node has no parent node and the leaf nodes have no child nodes.
//If the child node of a parent node has one or more child nodes, it is a subtree.
